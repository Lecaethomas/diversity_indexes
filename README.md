# Diversity Indexes
This repo store codes used to process raster and vectorial data aiming at computing/testing few diversity indices. 
These focus on showing diversity of classes of landcover in a raster layer. That diversity may speak out interms of raw number of classes, but also may be thought as diversity of spatial distribution (number of patches).
It may be useful for landscape ecologists or any other kind of domains aiming at assessing the diversity of raster cells contained in polygon data.
