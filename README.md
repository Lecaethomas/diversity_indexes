# Diversity Indexes
This repo store codes used to process raster and vectorial data aiming at computing/testing few diversity indices. 
### What for?
These focus on showing diversity of classes of landcover in a raster layer. That diversity may speak out interms of raw number of classes, but also may be thought as diversity of spatial distribution (number of patches).
### For who?
It may be useful for landscape ecologists or any other kind of domains aiming at assessing the diversity of raster cells contained in polygon data.
### How?
Despite the code had been parameterized, it still needs installs and little skills in coding (using conda for install, editing .json file...)
